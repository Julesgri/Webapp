HOW TO LAUNCH
To launch the assigment you have to put the 3 documents in the same repository and then launch the HTML folder.

HOW TO USE:
The app is fairly straight forward to use. the aim of the app is to be able to link actors to films to new actors to new films. in the first input bar you will have to give an actor that has played in fight club. if you are wrong the app will give you a list of actors that have played in the film and you will be invited to start again. In the second input bar that will appear after you have answered correctly to the first one, you will have to give a film that the actor that you gave has played in . if you are correct it will send you back up the page to continue the cycle, if not it will invite you to start again.
